# Personal Finance Tracker

Note: All financial information in the file is purely for demonstrational purposes only!

## Description
A personal finance tracker that only requires 4 inputs for a purchase (Date, Description (optional), Tag, and Price) which then runs a range of analytics for monthly data. 

We also need to set up the following fields at the start of the month: 
- Income,
- From Stocks (Additional income from stocks),
- Budget,
- Additional Expenses,
- Investments (-),
- Balance EOM (manually record bank balance at the end of month),
- Portfolio EOM (manually record portfolio balance at the end of month.

There are two sheets: 2024, and 2024 Dashboard 

### 2024
Takes the inputs, displays tabulated summary information for each month, and a breakdown of each category for each month. Also displays the average value for transactions of a category, and percentage breakdown for needs, wants and variables for each month.

### 2024 Dashboard
Again displays the tabulated summary information for each month and the average value for transactions in a category, however it also displays a line chart of total expendature to date, pie charts for each month with slices for categories, and a visual breakdown for needs, wants and varaibles
